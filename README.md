ANSI-ficator
============

###DESCRIPTION

ANSI-ficator is a program that will convert images into ANSI graphics with colors,
displaying the generated ANSI image in the program's window.
You can then save the generated image to a file.
	
It's being developed in C++ with Qt 4.8.1.
	
It supports input of all common image formats, including PNG, JPG, GIF and BMP.
It stretches the image you load to the needed resolution, optionally, you can
tell the program not to do this.
Currently, converted images may be saved as image files. (other kinds of output is planned.)
